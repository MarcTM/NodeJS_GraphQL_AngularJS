<h1>2DAW FIRST PROJECT</h1>

This web page works with 2 backends (GraphQL and Rest) and the fronten (AngularJS 1.5).  
Poject developed by *Marc Torres Mart√≠nez*.
Imagine a community of people who likes sharing his cooking recipes. This page is about it, it was the first idea I had and I kept doing this project with that idea. You can share your foods, favorite recipes, follow users, etc.

## Backend Application Structure

- `rest` - The REST backend works on Node.js and Express, mostly based in Thinkster's Conduit Node.JS example.
- `graphql` - The GraphQL backend works on Express with Apollo Server on /api and /api/graphqlauth (for authorization headers).

- `[rest]/app.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models used in the application.
- `[graphql]/index.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the models, the schemas and the resolvers used in the application.

- `[rest and graphql]/config/` - This folder contains configuration for passport as well as a central location for configuration/environment variables.
- `[rest an graphql]/models/` - This folder contains the Mongoose models definitions.
- `[rest]/routes/` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API.
- `graphql/src/graphql` - This folder contains the resolvers and schemas definitions for the GraphQL server.

## Frontend Application Structure

- `src` - Main frontend code in AngularJS 1.5.

- `src/js/components` - This folder contains the components helpers, for all the application.
- `src/js/services` - This folder contains the services for each module.
- `src/js/app.js` - The entry point to the application.
